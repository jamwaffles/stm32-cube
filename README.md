## APA106 timing

The APA106 is similar to the WS2812 in that is uses a single wire, timing-based bus to operate, however the timings are slightly different. Cycle time is 1.71us per bit, and a 1 or 0 is dictated by the duty cycle as below:

| Description    | Time   |
| -------------- | ------ |
| 0 bit on time  | 0.35us |
| 0 bit off time | 1.36us |
| 1 bit on time  | 1.36us |
| 1 bit off time | 0.35us |

This equates to a roughly 20% duty cycle for 0 bits and an 80% duty cycle for on bits.

There are a lot of libraries out there that use finely tuned assembly routines to generate the correct signalling, however I took the same approach as [Espruino](http://www.espruino.com/WS2811) and used the SPI bus on the TM4C123GH6PM micro. To generate the correct waveform I use two different nibbles (MSB sent first); `0b1000` is an "off" pulse and `0b1110` is an "on" pulse. The duty cycles here are 25% and 75% respectively, which is close enough to the permissible timing characteristics of the APA106 (Â±150ns, 11%) to not be an issue.

The cycle time for one bit is 1.71us, or ~585KHz. Because I use 4 SPI bits to transfer one APA106 data bit, that clock rate needs to be multiplied by 4, resulting in an SPI bus frequency of **~2.33MHz**. The exact frequency is determined by the values of the SSI clock registers, which are calculated with the formula

> SysClk / (CPSDVSR \* (1 + SCR))

In my case I'm using a `SysClk` of 80MHz so the closest CPSDVSR and SCR values I get are 2 and 16 respectively, resulting in a frequency of **2.35MHz**. This is close enough to the target frequency that it should work fine and does for me in testing.
